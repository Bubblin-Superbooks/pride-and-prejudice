<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">cold manner of our meeting yesterday.—Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"</p><p>"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,—"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."</p><p>"I have no right to give <em>my</em> opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for <em>me</em> to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.—Here you are in your own family."</p><p>"Upon my word I say no more <em>here</em> than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."</p></div> </div>
