<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of <em>me</em> should make <em>my</em> assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Fitzwilliam Darcy."</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
