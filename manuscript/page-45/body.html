But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</p><p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."</p><p>"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with <em>him</em>, if I were you."</p><p>"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you <em>never</em> to dance with him."</p><p>"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend <em>me</em> so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <em>right</em> to be proud."</p></div> </div>
